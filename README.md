# Hello World!
Welcome to the interactive [plgrnd.io](https://plgrnd.io/) HTML playground - just write your code and watch it update in real-time!

## Using GitHub Gists
You can load [Gists](https://gist.github.com/) into Plgrnd by their hash like that:

    https://plgrnd.io/#0054409c8e9f0270dab76f8fde977b4c

You can even **create a public Gist** from right here, just by pressing `Ctrl+Enter`. Pay attention to the changing URL!

## About
I'm [Moritz](https://mo-mar.de/), a web developer. And I like to quickly try out new things, so I made this. Sure, there are a few similar projects, but they all had some sort of problem - no live preview, everything is unnecessarily stored on a server for online collaboration ([which is pretty awesome if you need it](https://codr.io/)), or just plain ugly frameset stuff.

So, here it is: **Plgrnd**. It's simple, and fast. Everything "just works" and is a single page without clutter - exactly how I like it.
